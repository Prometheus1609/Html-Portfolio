<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Anastasios. I graduated form "Delta College" in Greece as a medical engineer in 2010. From 2012 i'm working 
  in the field of civil protection. I started taking lessons about web development in April of 2023. Web development has 
  always been my insatiable desire, but the appointment in civil protection put it on hold until now. I personally 
believe that achieving greatness in a particular field, derives from the love and passion you have for it. That's the 
reason why i started getting involved with it. </p>

<p>As soon as i will be finished with my lessons and have a portfolio that will meet your expectations, it would be an 
  honor for me to work with you. Thank you very much in advance.</p>
